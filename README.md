# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Key features include:

Simplicity: Easy to learn syntax.
Versatility: Suitable for web development, data analysis, AI, and more.
Community: Large support community and extensive libraries.
Examples of use cases:

Web development with frameworks like Django.
Data analysis with libraries like Pandas.


2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

1.Download Python from the official website.
2.Run the installer and follow the prompts.
3.Verify installation by running python --version in the command line.
4.Set up a virtual environment using python -m venv [env_name].

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

print("Hello, World!")
Key syntax elements:
print(): A function to output data to the console.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

Basic data types include:

Integers: Whole numbers without a decimal point.
Floats: Numbers with a decimal point.
Strings: A sequence of characters, enclosed in quotes.
Booleans: Represents truth values, True or False.
Example script:

x = 10          # Integer
y = 20.5        # Float
name = "Alice"  # String
is_valid = True # Boolean

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

Conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while) control the flow of execution.

Example if-else:

if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")

Example for loop:

for i in range(5):
    print(i)

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

Functions are reusable blocks of code.
Example function:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Call the function
result = add(3, 4)

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Lists are ordered collections, dictionaries are key-value pairs.

Example operations:

numbers = [1, 2, 3]
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
numbers.append(4)       # Add to list
my_dict['c'] = 3        # Add to dictionary

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling is a mechanism in Python to handle runtime errors without crashing the program.
Use try, except, and finally to handle errors gracefully.
Example:

try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
finally:
    print("This always executes")

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

Modules are files containing Python code. Packages are collections of modules.
Importing a module:
import math

result = math.sqrt(16)

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Reading from a file:
with open('file.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file:
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write('Hello, World!')

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
